Below are links to all the blogs and sites I own and maintain. They're all about the activities and things that I truly care about. In a way, they are a reflection of who I am.

##[Personal blog](http://blog.elmersia.com)

This blog is mostly about my personal thoughts and aspirations in life. Most content is all about my interest in computers, software development, and living a life of [Arete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete) (excellence).

##[My travel journal](http://travels.elmersia.com/) *(under construction)*

**I love traveling**. Aside from the obvious reasons and benefits of traveling, I mostly do it for spiritual reasons, especially if I do it alone. Spiritual because it allows me to recharge and center myself, meditate and introspect more about what I would want to do in my life, and most of all, be in awe of all of the Divine's creation.

##[Reading and book blog](http://www.readingjourneys.com)

**I love to read books**, especially topics on [self-help](http://www.noop.nl/2008/11/top-100-best-books-for-managers-leaders-humans.html) and [personal development](http://www.stevepavlina.com/personal-development-books.htm). This blog is where I review these books and where I share my experiences from applying the lessons I've learned from them.

##[Coding Tutorials Site](http://www.putshelloworld.com) *(under construction)*

This coding and software development tutorials site is a personal project of mine. Its goal is to share and teach the skills and technologies I've learned as a computer programmer to both beginner and intermediate level computer programmers and enthusiasts.
