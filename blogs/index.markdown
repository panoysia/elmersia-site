> "From the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks.."

I write most of my thoughts and experiences in a journal notebook, but now that I have the means to write them online, I couldn't stop anymore. [When I started to blog](http://blog.elmersia.com/hello-blogging/), so many thoughts, ideas, and [past experiences](http://www.putshelloworld.com) sprang out of my mind like water exploding from a tank. In short, let's just say I've been bitten by the blogging bug.

**I only blog about my passions and things I care about**. What I've written on my blogs are in a way [a reflection of who I am](http://www.readingjourneys.com) and what I value in life.

##   [Personal blog](http://blog.elmersia.com)

Mostly thoughts about my personal experiences on random things. Learnings  in computers and software development are a staple in this blog included as well, with a touch of personal development to .

I love writing down my thoughts, experiences on random things, and new learnings.

## [Travel blog and journal](http://www.putshelloworld.com)

**I love traveling**. Aside from the obvious reasons for traveling, I mostly do it for spiritual reasons, especially if I do it alone. Spiritual because it allows me to recharge and center myself, meditate and introspect more about what I would want to do in my life, and most of all, be in awe of all of the Divine's *(God, Allah, or any religion counterpart)* creation.

My experiences and perspectives to everything related to travel, i.e, people, places, food, culture, and arts are all in this blog. This is also where I would write and promote the wonderful things about the [province](http://www.iloilo.gov.ph) and [city of Iloilo](http://www.iloilocity.gov.ph/iloiloct2011wip/) (my hometown). 

##[Reading and book blog](http://www.readingjourneys.com)

**I love to read books**, especially topics on [self-help](http://www.noop.nl/2008/11/top-100-best-books-for-managers-leaders-humans.html) and [personal development](http://www.stevepavlina.com/personal-development-books.htm). Every time I read these types of books I make sure to jot down their concepts and lessons for further introspection and thinking.

This blog then is a way for me to share those teachings I've jotted down, together with my own experience and perspective from applying them in my life. It's also my own little way of inspiring and helping others to develop their selves, their self-awareness, and their identity. This is what self-help books have done to me and I intend to do the same to those who are willing to learn.
