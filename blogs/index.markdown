> "From the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks.."

I occasionally write my thoughts, ideas, and experiences in a journal notebook, but [when I tried blogging](http://blog.elmersia.com/hello-blogging/), the frequency and motivation to write worthwhile things really increased. Many thoughts, ideas, and [past experiences](http://www.putshelloworld.com) sprang out of my mind like an exploding water tank. In short, let's just say I've been bitten by the blogging bug.

**I only blog about my passions and things I care about**. What I've written on my blogs are in a way [a reflection of who I am](http://www.readingjourneys.com) and [what I value in life](http://blog.elmersia.com).

##   [Personal blog](http://blog.elmersia.com)

Mostly personal thoughts and aspirations in life. Learnings  in computers, technology, and software development are a staple in this blog too. I also add personal development to the mix to outgrow and prove to myself that I want to be better in life.

## [Travel blog and journal](http://www.putshelloworld.com)

**I love traveling**. Aside from the obvious reasons for traveling, I mostly do it for spiritual reasons, especially if I do it alone. Spiritual because it allows me to recharge and center myself, meditate and introspect more about what I would want to do in my life, and most of all, be in awe of all of the Divine's *(God, Allah, or any religion counterpart)* creation.

My experiences and perspectives to everything related to travel, i.e, people, places, food, culture, and arts are all in this blog. This is also where I would write and promote the wonderful things about the [province](http://www.iloilo.gov.ph) and [city of Iloilo](http://www.iloilocity.gov.ph/iloiloct2011wip/) (my hometown). 

##[Reading and book blog](http://www.readingjourneys.com)

**I love to read books**, especially topics on [self-help](http://www.noop.nl/2008/11/top-100-best-books-for-managers-leaders-humans.html) and [personal development](http://www.stevepavlina.com/personal-development-books.htm). Every time I read these types of books I make sure to jot down their concepts and lessons for further introspection and thinking.

This blog then is a way for me to share those teachings I've jotted down, together with my own experience and perspective from applying them in my life. It's also my own little way of inspiring and helping others to develop their selves, their self-awareness, and their identity. This is what self-help books have done to me and I intend to do the same to those who are willing to learn.
