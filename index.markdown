Hi! Iâ€™m Elmer A. Sia, a freelance computer programmer and part-time computer instructor from Iloilo City, Philippines. 

I focus on server-side scripting and web application development using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) respectively. Try visiting my [LinkedIn profile](http://ph.linkedin.com/in/panoysia) if you're interested in working with me.

In my spare time, I pursue my hobbies and [blog about them](http://blog.elmersia.com). I also [share my learnings on computer programming](http://www.putshelloworld.com) on the web.

I'm best reached at [pragmatic_panoy@yahoo.com](mailto:pragmatic_panoy@yahoo.com). But you can also tweet me [@panoy_sia](https://twitter.com/panoy_sia) if you like.
