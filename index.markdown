I'm a freelance computer programmer and part-time computer instructor. I love to program and solve problems using the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language and the [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web development framework for web application development.

I also teach web development to college students with strong focus on [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript), [PHP](http://www.php.net/), and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/). 

In my spare time, I pursue my hobbies and [blog about them](http://blog.elmersia.com). I also [share my learnings on computer programming](http://www.putshelloworld.com) on the web. I try as much to learn more about open source tools and programming languages, and is really enamored in using and working with UNIX-like OSes like [Linux](http://www.linux.com/) and [OS X](https://www.apple.com/osx/).

Contact me if you're interested in hiring or working with me. See my [LinkedIn profile](http://ph.linkedin.com/in/panoysia) if you're interested in my work history and education.
