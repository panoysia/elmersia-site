Hi! I’m **Elmer A. Sia**, a 28 year-old computer programmer from [Iloilo City, Philippines](http://www.iloilocity.gov.ph/). My nickname is &ldquo;[Panoy](http://twitter.com/panoy_sia)&rdquo;, you can call me that if you want.

Currently, I am focusing on server-side scripting and creating web applications using the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language and the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web development framework respectively.

In the past, I’ve worked as a computer programmer in a [local university](http://www.jblfmu.edu.ph/) creating and maintaining desktop database applications using Microsoft Visual Basic 6 and either MySQL or Microsoft Access.

I am passionate in (continuous) learning and teaching the craft of software development and activities that relate to it. My interests are mostly in learning new programming languages, databases, and code quality.

My other healthy distractions are [personal blogging](http://blog.elmersia.com), [teaching](http://www.putshelloworld.com), [traveling](http://travels.elmersia.com), [reading, and everything related to personal development](http://www.readingjourneys.com).

I’m also very open to mentoring, community collaboration and advocacy like developer groups and technology evangelism. Please don’t hesitate to [contact me](http://www.elmersia.com/contact) if you’re in need of [my skills and services](http://www.elmersia.com/services).
