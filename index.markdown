Hi, I'm **Elmer A. Sia**. You can also call me &ldquo;[Panoy](http://twitter.com/panoy_sia)&rdquo; if you want. I am passionate about life and in everything that I do, whether it's software development, pursuing my hobbies, or living a life of [Arete](http://www.thespartanwarrior.com/post/10489125518/arete) and [simplicity](http://zenhabits.net).

By choice and passion, **I am a freelance software developer** and I hail from [Iloilo City](http://www.iloilocity.gov.ph/iloiloct2011wip/index.php) - The Philippines' City of Love. In the past six years, I've professionally used [Visual Basic 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) to create database applications. I've now switched to using [open-source](http://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) programming languages and frameworks such as [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) respectively.

This is both my personal and future portfolio site where I will list the projects (mainly software) I'm working on, and my current and future career endeavors in life. Feel free to browse around to know more about me and my other interests.

# Work Status

I am currently available for either full-time or part-time software development or programming work using Ruby and Sinatra. I mostly prefer server-side work using these tools.

I'm also open to community collaboration. Whether its contributing to open-source projects, technology awareness, or creating software for community use, I'm all up for it.

My skills are listed in my [services page](/services), and please don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact) if you're interested in working with me in those said activities above.

# The present is a gift

I spend most of my time learning server-side web development, making projects and getting proficient using Ruby and Sinatra. Learning [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) is also next in line, plus some familiarity with any [decent JavaScript framework](http://todomvc.com).

What I'm doing right now is way different from the [desktop application development](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/ms788229.aspx) that I'm accustomed to. It looks like I'm starting all over again, but I am not afraid because there are software development knowledge and practices I've learned over those years that are universally applicable regardless of platform. 

On my free time, I do some writing on [my blogs](/blogs), read books, travel, and [play around with various tools and apps](http://blog.elmersia.com/tools/) to augment my software development skills.

# The past has passed

For the past 6 years, I've been a database programmer creating [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) desktop applications using Visual Basic 6 and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com). 

I'm quite aware of how VB6 programmers have been ridiculed in the computer programming industry and even overshadowed by it's [.NET](http://www.microsoft.com/net) counterpart, the [C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/vstudio/hh341490.aspx) programming language. Yet I take nothing away from VB6 because it's where I first developed my love for programming and experienced the fun of doing it.

Aside from procrastinating in my career, my one big mistake was not learning web development during those years because I was adamant on it and my biased on desktop/native development. The good thing now is that I've learned from it and doing my best to learn open-source tools and web development. [Hope springs eternal](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rywang/berkeley/magic3/paris/singles/eternal_spring.html).

# The future looks brighter

As much as I can, I'd love to be in the software development industry all my life. I'd love to pursue challenging work, activities, and responsibilities within this industry that would help grow and expand my craft, and at the same time bring out the best of my talents and character. Just a number of things I have in mind:

* open-source evangelism and teaching, i.e, mainly Ruby, Sinatra, Rails 
* becoming a software development trainer and speaker
* mentoring less privileged but passionate individuals about software development and life in general
* [local community](http://www.iloilocity.gov.ph/iloiloct2011wip/index.php) awareness on how technology and software can impact their lives
* creating software for the local community or any non-profit organization


The list I've written is something I can look forward into. They're not absolute or fixed goals, rather they're **possibilities that I leave myself open to**. The journey will be long â€” but fun, and there's even no assurance of the destination.
