#Services:

* **Scripting and web application development**

I use Ruby and the Ruby on Rails framework for scripting and web application development respectively.

* **Computer programming mentoring and tutorials**

I love teaching and mentoring individuals who want to learn programming or those that want to improve their software development practices.

* **~~Windows database programming using Visual Basic 6~~**

I no longer practice my VB6 skills, I just list it here as a reminder that I've done this work for over six years ago, professionally and proficiently. Throw in MySQL and GUI components from [Codejock](http://www.codejock.com) and I was good to go.

* **~~Technological community speaking~~**

This is one my plans, but not now. I have yet to practice my speaking and presentation skills. I'm excited to do this especially in local technological communities such as developer groups, in private seminars, and the academe.
