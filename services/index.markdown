#Services 

I offer the following services:

I no longer practice my VB6 skills, I just list it here as a reminder that I've done this work for over six years ago, professionally and proficiently. Throw in MySQL and GUI components from [Codejock](http://www.codejock.com) and I was good to go.

* **Scripting and web development using Ruby and Sinatra**

I use Ruby as my general purpose programming language as long as it's applicable, while I use Sinatra for web development. I mostly prefer server-side development, but for client-side, I make use of frameworks and libraries such as [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) or [Gumby](http://gumbyframework.com), and [jQuery](http://jquery.com) respectively.

* **Computer programming mentoring and tutorials**

I love teaching and mentoring individuals who want to learn programming or those that want to improve their software development practices.

I can also help business 

If you're either a business manager in software  o can also mentor you on the human-side aspects of software development.

I can teach you good practices I've learned 

* **Writing and blogging**
