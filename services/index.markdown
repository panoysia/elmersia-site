# Hire me

I am a self-aware, honest, and passionate person both in life and in my career as a software developer. I'm very secure with my knowledge and skills, in what I can and can not do. I have a [solid grasp of my strengths](http://blog.elmersia.com/my-top-five-strengths/) and I [continue to sharpen](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/03/sharpening-the-saw.html) and [strive to be better than yesterday](https://twitter.com/ShihanQuotes/status/274513224269975552).

Innately curious and meticulous, I am very attentive to details and have an eye for improving work and processes better and efficient. My [past work experience](/resume) taught me the value of initiative, flexibility, open-mindedness, and most of all, [responsibility](http://blog.elmersia.com/my-top-five-strengths/). 

Most of all, I am confident that what makes me stand out is my character and values. I depend on them, no matter how big the task, responsibilities, or failures I will encounter in life.

#Services 

I offer the following services:

* **~~Windows database programming using Visual Basic 6~~**

I no longer practice my VB6 skills, I just list it here as a reminder that I've done this work for over six years ago, professionally and proficiently. Throw in MySQL and GUI components from [Codejock](http://www.codejock.com) and I was good to go.

* **Scripting and web development using Ruby and Sinatra**

I use Ruby as my general purpose programming language as long as it is applicable, while I use Sinatra for web development. I mostly prefer server-side development, but for client-side, I make use of frameworks and libraries such as [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) or [Gumby](http://gumbyframework.com), and [jQuery](http://jquery.com) respectively.

* **Computer programming mentoring and tutorials**

I love teaching and mentoring individuals who want to learn programming or those that want to improve their software development practices. I'd also like to educate non-technical individuals (managers) about the human-side aspects of software development.

* **Writing and blogging** 

I'm also open to some online writing and blogging work as long as I am interested in the subject. I see nothing wrong with it as I find writing or blogging to be both relaxing and challenging.

<h1 id="tech">Technical Skills</h1>
I'm continually growing my knowledge and skills, so this list is not finite. These are currently my strongest skills:

* ~~Visual Basic 6~~
* Ruby, Sinatra
* MySQL, [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com)
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Octopress](http://octopress.org)
